# Cloud Storage Integration Notes

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Storage Abstraction Layer**
   - Created modular storage system in `src/storage/`
   - Support for multiple providers through common interface
   - Easy to extend with new providers

2. **UploadThing Integration**
   - Full implementation in `src/storage/uploadthing.ts`
   - Uploads images and returns URLs
   - Falls back to base64 on upload failure

3. **MCP Server Integration**
   - Server checks for configured storage provider
   - Uploads images after generation
   - Returns URLs when storage is configured
   - Returns base64 when storage is disabled

4. **Configuration**
   - Environment variable support
   - `STORAGE_PROVIDER` to select provider
   - Provider-specific configuration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **UploadThing Token Validation**
   - The UploadThing API is returning "Invalid token" errors
   - Token format appears correct (base64 encoded JSON with apiKey, appId, regions)
   - Direct testing with UTApi works, but fails in MCP context
   - This may be due to:
     - Large file sizes (1-2MB images)
     - Different runtime environment in MCP server
     - Token encoding/decoding issues

### üöß Future Work

1. **S3-Compatible Storage**
   - Implementation stub exists but not completed
   - Would support: AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, Vultr Object Storage, etc.
   - Benefits: Self-hosted option, wider compatibility

2. **Error Handling**
   - Better error messages for token issues
   - Retry logic for transient failures
   - Size validation before upload

3. **Performance**
   - Concurrent uploads for multiple images
   - Progress reporting for large uploads
   - Caching of uploaded images

## Usage

### Enable UploadThing (when working)
```env
STORAGE_PROVIDER=uploadthing
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

### Disable Storage (default)
```env
STORAGE_PROVIDER=none
```

## Benefits When Working

1. **Smaller Responses**: URLs are ~100 characters vs 1-2MB base64
2. **Ready for Web**: Images immediately accessible via HTTPS
3. **Better Performance**: No base64 encoding/decoding overhead
4. **Client Compatibility**: Solves timeout issues with large responses
